Collection of my learning of the German language from algorithms, tools, methods to standard lessons etc. (expect anything :-D)

## Vocabulary

### Deutsch-Test für Zuwanderer (B1)
The Goethe-Institut provides the following [pdf](http://www.goethe.de/lhr/pro/daz/dfz/dtz_Wortliste.pdf) as a collection of words to know for the "Deutsch-Test für Zuwanderer" exam.

To make use of flash card applications, I extracted the word list and their inflected forms to a [txt file](vocabulary/goethe-institut-dtz-word-list.txt). The extractor attempts to parse and detect the pdf correctly however their could be some errors due to the format of the PDF.

## Grammar
Lessons are organized in Markdown language.
